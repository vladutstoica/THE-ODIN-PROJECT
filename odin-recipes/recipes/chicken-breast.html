    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        The great blend of spices on these broiled chicken breasts has a wonderful flavor and pairs well with many
        vegetable side dishes.
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 ½ tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, divided </li>
        <li>2 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves </li>
        <li>2 tablespoons paprika</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon lemon-pepper seasoning</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon kosher salt </li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, smashed and finely chopped </li>
        <li>½ medium onion, chopped </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Set an oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler. Grease a broiler pan
            with 1/2 tablespoon olive oil.
        </li>
        <li>
            Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
        </li>
        <li>
            Rinse chicken breasts and pat dry. Brush with remaining olive oil until coated. Sprinkle each piece evenly
            on both sides with paprika, lemon-pepper, and salt. Place on the prepared broiler pan, sprinkle garlic over
            top, and sprinkle onions around the base of the chicken, with several smaller pieces on top.
        </li>
        <li>
            Cook under the preheated broiler for 5 minutes. Flip and continue to cook, checking often, until no longer
            pink in the center and the juices run clear, 5 to 10 more minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into
            the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
        </li>
    </ol>
