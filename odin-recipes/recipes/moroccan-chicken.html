        <li>1 teaspoon ras el hanout </li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil </li>

        <li>2 tablespoons shelled pistachios, coarsely chopped </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Combine lemon juice, lemon zest, 2 tablespoons olive oil, 1 1/2 teaspoons ras el hanout, and 1/2 teaspoon
            salt in a resealable plastic bag. Place chicken thighs into the bag, making sure marinade gets under skin.
            Seal and refrigerate at least 30 minutes. Remove chicken from refrigerator 20 minutes before baking and let
            come to room temperature.
        </li>
        <li>
            Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
        </li>
        <li>
            Combine sweet potato, zucchini, chickpeas and artichoke hearts in a bowl. Sprinkle with 1 teaspoon ras el
            hanout and 1/2 teaspoon salt. Drizzle with 2 tablespoons olive oil and stir to combine evenly.
        </li>
        <li>
            Remove chicken from marinade and place on a 13x18-inch rimmed sheet pan. Place vegetable mixture around
            chicken.
        </li>
        <li>
            Bake in the preheated oven, flipping vegetables halfway through, or until chicken has reached an internal
            temperature of 165 degrees F (74 degrees C), about 30 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Remove from oven and garnish with pomegranate seeds, parsley, and pistachios before serving.
        </li>
    </ol>
