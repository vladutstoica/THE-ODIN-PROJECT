    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Chicken stock, wine, onions, garlic, mushroom, cream, butter, herbs, lemon, and capers reduce to make a perfect
        sauce. Served alongside mushroom rice and asparagus; it is HEAVEN! Patience is key with the sauce. The flavors
        will come together beautifully if you allow them to reduce as directed. </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups chicken broth</li>
        <li>½ cup chopped onion</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced </li>
        <li>1 cup white wine </li>
        <li>½ cup sliced fresh mushrooms, or more to taste </li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried rosemary </li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried sage</li>
        <li>1 cup heavy cream </li>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter </li>
        <li>½ lemon, juiced </li>
        <li>1 tablespoon capers, drained </li>
        <li>½ cup cornstarch, or as needed </li>
        <li>4 skinless, boneless chicken thighs </li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Pour the chicken broth into a saucepan with the onion and garlic; bring to a boil and cook at a boil until
            the liquid reduces by half, about 10 minutes. Pour in the white wine, return to a boil, and reduce the
            liquid by half again, about 10 minutes. Stir in mushrooms, rosemary, and sage; simmer until the mushrooms
            are tender and have given up their juice, about 15 more minutes. Stir in cream, butter, lemon, and capers;
            reduce heat and simmer the sauce until thickened, about 10 minutes (45 minutes in all).
        </li>
        <li>
            Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
        </li>
        <li>
            Place the cornstarch into a shallow bowl and press the chicken thighs into the cornstarch on all sides until
            thoroughly coated. Shake off excess cornstarch. Heat the olive oil in a skillet over medium heat; pan-fry
            the chicken thighs until they develop a golden brown crust, about 8 minutes per side. Place the chicken
            thighs into a 9x9-inch baking dish and pour the sauce over the chicken.
        </li>
        <li>
            Bake in the preheated oven until the sauce is bubbling and the chicken is no longer pink in the center,
            about 15 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center of a chicken thigh should read at
            least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
        </li>
    </ol>
